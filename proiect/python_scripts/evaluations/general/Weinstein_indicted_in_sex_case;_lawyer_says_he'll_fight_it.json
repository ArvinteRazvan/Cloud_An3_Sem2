Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said the indictment brings Weinstein \"another step closer to accountability\" for alleged attacks on two women in New York. Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he would \"vigorously defend\" against the indictment and ask a court to dismiss it. He called the allegations \"unsupported\" and reiterated that Weinstein strongly denies them.", "url": "https://apnews.com/8e1afa56f76040adb3a1158a8d1e2f5f", "urlToImage": "https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:07058b025cc84c85acc08be4e1317b06/3000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-05-30T22:35:18Z", "clasificare": {"general": 0.2714096578306511, "technology": 0.43443996267974827, "sports": 0.3027269978890279, "business": 0.47778800426593027, "entertainment": 0.33497666163517936, "science": 0.4508317483728649}}
