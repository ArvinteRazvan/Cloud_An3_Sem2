Authorities said his death had been staged to foil a plot on his life by Moscow's security services and one arrest was made. Russia denounced the faked killing as an outlandish attempt at defamation by its neighbor and foe. Even Babchenko's wife was unaware of the deception, and the 41-year-old Kremlin critic who fled to Ukraine 15 months ago apologized to her \"for the hell she had to go through in the past two days. There was no choice there, either.\"", "url": "https://apnews.com/071e708bf9c14e11af25a89e08cf2b4f", "urlToImage": "https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:0bd66b26b9cf4d2d9b38226f4547bc05/3000.jpeg", "publishedAt": "2018-05-30T20:01:32Z", "clasificare": {"general": 0.1830933015408331, "technology": 0.268139444850158, "sports": 0.38670297147582655, "business": 0.22234816868178403, "entertainment": 0.26219896741326554, "science": 0.34224219229780617}}
